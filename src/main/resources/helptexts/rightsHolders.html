<p>Owner of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>In publications, clear reference is always made to the individual or organization that is holder
    of the copyright. In principle, the right to publish and reproduce a publication, scientific or
    otherwise, is vested in the author(s) or organization where the author(s) are employed. This
    copyright may, however, have been transferred to a commercial or non-commercial publisher. </p>
<p>Insofar as datasets are concerned, the copyright is usually vested in the creator(s). In most
    cases, the field ‘Creator' is used to fill in the name of the researcher, and the field
    ‘(Copy)right holder' is used to fill in the name of the organization where he/she is employed.
</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: If you do not fill in the holder of the copyrights or intellectual property
    rights here, the
    right will be assigned automatically to the individual or organization referred to ‘Creator'. If
    the publication or the dataset has been reused, the creator(s) must be granted the scientific
    credits for his/her/their work in the form of clear source references.</p>
