<p>If the dataset is known under multiple titles, such as subtitles and/or a translation of the
    title, you can enter these titles in this field.
    Subtitles are often used to include references to the specific location of the excavation site,
    the date, or the project code of the site(s).
    This field may also be used to fill in the report number.</p>
<p>When performing a search in EASY, you will be able to find the words from the ‘Title' as well as
    words from the ‘Alternative title'.
    The only difference is that the ‘Title' is shown immediately in the list of search results,
    whereas the ‘Alternative title' is not.</p>
