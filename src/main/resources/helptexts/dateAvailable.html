<p>By default, you make the data available today. However, you can impose an embargo, e.g.
    because of a publication that is about to be completed. Until the date specified by you,
    the data files will be visible but not be accessible by any user. After that date, your
    dataset becomes automatically available under the conditions specified under Access rights.
    The maximum embargo period is two years, starting today.</p>
