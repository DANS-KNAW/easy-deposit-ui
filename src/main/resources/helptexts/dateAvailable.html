<h1>Date available</h1>
<p>You can use this option to impose a temporary restriction, e.g. because of a thesis/publication
    that is about to be completed.
    The default date available is today. To impose a temporary restriction, change the date into a
    date in the future.
    Until that date specified by you, the data files will not be accessible by any user.
    After that date, your dataset becomes automatically available for registered EASY users, under
    the conditions you specified under Access rights.
    The embargo period (time between today and the date specified) cannot be longer than two years.
</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: data files which are not yet available will still be visible to other users.
