<p>You can use this option to impose an embargo: a temporary restriction on the access of the data
    files, e.g. because of a thesis/publication that is about to be completed. The default date
    available is today. To impose a temporary restriction, change the date into a date in the
    future. Until that date specified by you, the data files will not be accessible by any user.
    After that date, your dataset becomes automatically available for registered EASY users, under
    the conditions you specified under Access rights. The embargo period cannot be longer than two
    years and cannot be extended.
</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: data files which are not yet available will still be visible to other users.
