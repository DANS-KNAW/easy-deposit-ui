<p>Descriptive keywords and complex type (Archis site type) in accordance with the standardized
    terms from the ‘Archeologisch Basis Register' (ABR, Archaeological Basic Register).</p>
<p>The ‘Subject' field is used to describe the contents of the research project and the files
    deposited.
    A standardized list of complex types from the ‘Archeologisch Basis Register' (Archis 1992) is
    available here in the form of a drop-down menu. In addition to the date and the geographical
    location of the excavation, the type of site is an essential characteristic for retrieving
    archaeological information by means of a targeted search.
</p>
<p>The free text field can furthermore be used to fill in all kinds of other descriptive keywords.
    In addition to general characteristics, keywords can also be used to refer to specific finds or
    results. If the keywords originate from a controlled list of keywords, fill in the name of the
    thesaurus. If this list of keywords cannot be chosen as a scheme, fill in the keyword followed
    by the name of the thesaurus in brackets.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: Any details on the date are recorded separately at ‘Temporal coverage' and
    need not be included in the general keywords.</p>
<p>Click the [+] button behind a field to add an additional field. It is also possible to fill in
    several keywords behind each other in one field if they are separated from each other by a
    semicolon followed by a space (; ).</p>
