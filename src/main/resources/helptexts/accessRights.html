<p>The DANS policy is "Open Access when possible and Restricted Access when necessary".</p>
<p>You have a choice of two access categories. The category only applies to the files in the dataset,
    because metadata is always freely available.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open Access: accessible to everyone, no login required.</li>
    <li>Restricted Access: with your prior consent, users may view and download data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When opting for Open Access, you can place your dataset in the public domain with the Creative
    Commons Zero Waiver (CC0). Alternatively, you can choose from various usage licences, including
    the Creative Commons Licenses.</p>
<p>With Restricted Access, use of the dataset is always subject to the DANS Licence. If necessary,
    you can impose additional conditions when users request permission to access the dataset.</p>
<p>If your dataset contains personal data, other than the personal data to account for the dataset
    such as the data creator, only Restricted Access can apply.</p>
