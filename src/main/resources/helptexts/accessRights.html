<p>The DANS policy is "Open Access when possible and Restricted Access when necessary".</p>

<ol>
    <li>If your data or metadata contain personal data, the dataset falls under "Restricted Access".
        You as depositor have the exclusive ability to grant or deny a permission request.
        A permission request is sent to the email address used for your user account. The DANS licence,
        which automatically applies to a Restricted Access dataset, describes what a future dataset
        user can and should do after being granted permission.</li>
    <li>In specific cases you might decide that access to a dataset without personal data must still
        be restricted. When you choose this option, the permission request process and the DANS licence
        apply as described above. When in doubt, please contact DANS at
        <a href="mailto:info@dans.knaw.nl" target="_blank">info@dans.knaw.nl</a>.</li>
    <li>However, if your dataset falls under "Open Access", you must select either the
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Zero Waiver (CC0)</a>
        or a Creative Commons licence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the metadata you are now providing are always freely accessible to everyone, even when access
    to the data is restricted.</p>
