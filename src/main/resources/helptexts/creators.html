<h1>Creator</h1>
<p>The person AND organization responsible for the dataset.</p>
<p>Name of the person or organization that is primarily responsible for the contents of the dataset.
    The description of a publication usually specifies the author(s) or the editor(s).
    With regard to a dataset (collection of digital files belonging together), this will often be
    the project manager.
    The dataset will be registered in the name of the ‘Creator(s)' and this name will subsequently
    be used in the source references for this dataset.
    Other persons or organizations that have contributed to the realization of the publication or
    the dataset must not be filled in at ‘Creator', but at the separate field ‘Contributor'.
    Contrary to the name(s) of the ‘Contributor', the name of the ‘Creator' will be shown in the
    search results.</p>
<p>Fill in the complete name, preferably in the following way: surname, title(s), initials,
    insertions, and, if desired, the organizational role within the project in brackets.
    If the ‘Creator' is an organization, first state the name of the division and subsequently the
    name of the organization.</p>
