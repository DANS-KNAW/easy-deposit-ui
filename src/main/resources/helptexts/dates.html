<p>In addition to the 'Dateset created' (above) and the 'Temporal coverage' in tab 'Temporal and
    spatial coverage', one or more other periods may be important to the formation of the dataset.
    Think, for example, of the date on which the project was closed, when this date is much later
    than the date on which the digital files were completed (select "issued" from the menu) or the
    date on which entries were changed (select "modified").</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The date on which the digital files were closed should be recorded at 'Dataset created'.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fields 'Date Submitted' (date of deposit) and 'Date Available' (expiration of a
    temporary embargo on access) are automatically created by the archive.</p>

<p>Always use the first field for a specific date. Use the free text field only for other date information,
    such as a date range.</p>
