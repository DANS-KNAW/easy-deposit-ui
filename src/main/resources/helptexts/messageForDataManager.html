<p>You can use this field to send requests to the DANS data manager.
    This is particularly useful when depositing a dataset with both ‘Open access’ and ‘Restricted
    access: request permission’ files.
    In such cases, you use this field to indicate which files should be made available according to
    which access category.
    Also, if the paper to which the dataset relates has not yet been published, you can mention in
    this field where and when the paper is expected to be published.
    If your files are too big to upload, you can also mention that here, and submit the dataset
    without the files.
    The data manager who processes your dataset will contact you to discuss alternative methods of
    depositing and accessing the files.
