    For example, in case the paper to which the dataset relates has not yet been published,
    you can mention in this field where and when the paper is expected to be published.</p>
<p>If your files are too big to upload, you can mention that here, and submit the dataset

    alternative methods of depositing and accessing the files.</p>
<p>If you want to deposit a dataset with both "Open access" and "Restricted access" files,

    During depositing you use this field to indicate which files should be made available
    according to which access category. The dataset itself will be of category "Restricted Access".</p>
