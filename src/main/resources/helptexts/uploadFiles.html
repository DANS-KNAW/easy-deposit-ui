<p>Here you can upload all files: data and documentation. If you have many files or want to maintain
    a directory structure, it is recommended to make a zip file of all directories and to upload this
    file. While uploading, the zip file will be unpacked again in its original directory structure.
    The archive automatically generates a checksum for each file, which will be used for monitoring
    the fileâ€™s integrity. If you wish you can check the checksum yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the dataset is very large (i.e. larger than 256 MB), if one or more files are larger than 2 GB, or if you want to
    deposit privacy sensitive data, it is recommended to send the files to DANS by means of a different
    file sharing medium such as SURFfilesender. Please contact DANS for more information at
    <a href="mailto:info@dans.knaw.nl" target="_blank">info@dans.knaw.nl</a>.</p>
<p>If you send the files without using EASY, it is still possible to finish the project description in
    EASY: just click 'submit' on the last page without uploading any files. You can indicate in the
    field 'Message for the data manager' that you will forward the files.</p>
