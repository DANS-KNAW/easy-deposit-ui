<p>Please add information about analogous or digital resources related to the dataset
    that you are depositing.</p>
<p>Use this field to fill in the identifiers or titles of publications, reports (internal
    or otherwise), websites and/or other digital resources (datasets, online publications)
    that belong to the research project.</p>
<p>Please specify the relation(s) between the current dataset - which you are depositing -
    and the other resources in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conforms to:</strong> (the current dataset) conforms to a particular standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Has format:</strong> (the current dataset) is substantially the same as a related
        resource, but in another format.</li>
    <li><strong>Has part:</strong> (the current dataset) includes a related resource.</li>
    <li><strong>References:</strong> (the current dataset) references, cites, or otherwise refers to
        a related resource.</li>
    <li><strong>Replaces:</strong> (the current dataset) supplants, displaces, or supersedes a related
        dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Requires:</strong> (the current dataset) requires a related resource to support its
        function, delivery, or coherence.</li>
    <li><strong>Has version:</strong> there exists a related dataset which is a version, edition, or
        adaptation of (the current dataset).</li>
    <li><strong>Is format of:</strong> there exists a related source that is substantially the same
        as (the current dataset), but in another format.</li>
    <li><strong>Is version of:</strong> (the current dataset) is a version, edition, or adaptation
        of a related dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Is part of:</strong> (the current dataset) is included in a related resource.</li>
    <li><strong>Is referenced by:</strong> there exists a related resource that references, cites,
        or otherwise points to (the current dataset).</li>
    <li><strong>Is replaced by:</strong> (the current dataset) is supplanted, displaced, or superseded
        by a related dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Is required by:</strong> there exists a related resource that requires (the current
        dataset) to support its function, delivery, or coherence.</li>
    <li><strong>Is version of:</strong> (the current dataset) is a version, edition, or adaptation
        of a related resource. This involves substantive changes in content rather
        than differences in format (see: Is format of).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the related resource has a DOI, URN, ISBN, ISSN, or NWO project identifier, use the first option.
    Select a relation; next, choose the relevant type of identifier; finally, fill in this identifier
    to refer to the related resource. For resources without such an identifier, please use the free text
    option to add a full title description and, where possible, the web address (URL) where to find this
    information.</p>
<p>Please use the field â€˜Source' for resources that have served as basis for the dataset.</p>
