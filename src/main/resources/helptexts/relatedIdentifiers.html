<p>Other analogous or digital resources related to the dataset of this research project.</p>
<p>Use this field to fill in the titles of publications, reports (internal or otherwise), websites
    and/or other digital resources (datasets, online publications) that belong to the research
    project. Add a full title description and, where possible, also fill in the web address (URL)
    where to find this information.
    By means of a ‘qualifier' it is possible to specify the relation between the dataset deposited
    here and the other sources referred to. Several examples of qualifiers that often occur:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>for a literature reference: isReferencedBy;</li>
    <li>is part of a larger project: isPartOf;</li>
    <li>replaces a previous deposit: replaces;</li>
    <li>is replaced by: isReplacedBy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: If you are filling in the address of a website in the URL field, take
    account of the fact
    that the website may no longer be accessible after some time. It is recommended to use only
    ‘persistent identifiers', URLs or identifiers of digital archives. Use the ‘Verify' button to
    check whether the URL has been written correctly and actually works.
</p>
<p>The field ‘Source' can be used to fill in analogous and digital resources that have served as
    bases for the dataset.
