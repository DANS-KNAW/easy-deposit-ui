    and the other resources in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Conforms to: (the current dataset) conforms to a particular standard.</li>

    <li>Replaces: (the current dataset) supplants, displaces, or supersedes a related dataset.</li>
    <li>Requires: (the current dataset) requires a related resource to support its
        function, delivery, or coherence.</li>
    <li>Has version: there exists a related dataset which is a version, edition, or
        adaptation of (the current dataset).</li>
    <li>Is format of: there exists a related source that is substantially the same

    <li>Is version of: (the current dataset) is a version, edition, or adaptation
        of a related resource. This involves substantive changes in content rather
        than differences in format (see: Is format of).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the related resource has a DOI, URN, ISBN, ISSN, or NWO project identifier, use the first option.
    Select a relation; next, choose the relevant type of identifier; finally, fill in this identifier
    to refer to the related resource. For resources without such an identifier, please use the free text
    option to add a full title description and, where possible, the web address (URL) where to find this
    information.</p>
<p>Please use the field â€˜Source' for resources that have served as basis for the dataset.</p>
