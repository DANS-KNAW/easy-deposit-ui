<h1>Date created</h1>
<p>Date on which the research project was finished and the dataset was completed. This is often a
    different date from the date on which you deposit the data.
    The deposit date is added to the metadata automatically. Please note: for archaeological reports
    use the date of publication</p>
<p>This is the field where you fill in the date on which the research project was finished and, as a
    result of this, the dataset was completed.
    Please use the standardized date notation (ISO), in the form of YYYY-[MM]-[DD]. The ‘Date
    created' will form a part of the source references.
    If the data have been collected and processed during a medium to long period of time, please
    fill in the end date here.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: At ‘Temporal coverage' on the next tab, you can indicate to what period (date) the research
    relates.
    This is where you can indicate, for example, that an early Bronze Age site has been
    researched.</p>
