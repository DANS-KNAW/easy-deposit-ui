<p>If you have received CLARIN funding for the data that you are about to deposit,
    your dataset ought to contain (preferably) one or (if necessary) more metadata
    files in the so-called Component MetaData Infrastructure (CDMI) format. Also,
    when you have received a research grant that requires you to deliver your results
    in a CLARIN-compatible way, CMDI metadata should be part of the dataset. For
    information about CMDI please see: <a href="http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi" target="_blank">http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi</a>.
    To enable us to make your CMDI metadata available to e.g. external search engines
    please select the second option.</p>
