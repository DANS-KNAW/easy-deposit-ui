<p>
    Metadata are an important instrument to make your data visible and findable.
    If you have received CLARIN funding for the data that you are about to deposit,
    your dataset ought to contain (preferably) one or (if necessary) more metadata files in the
    so-called Component MetaData Infrastructure (CDMI) format,
    which is an XML format. Also, when you have received a research grant that requires you to
    deliver your results in a CLARIN-compatible way,
    CMDI metadata should be part of the dataset.
    For information about CMDI please see: <a href="http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi">http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi</a>.
    To enable EASY to make your CMDI metadata available to e.g. external search engines please
    select the second option.
