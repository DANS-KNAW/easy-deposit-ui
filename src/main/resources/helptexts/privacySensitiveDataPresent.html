<p>DANS needs to know whether your dataset contains personal data in the sense of the General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In the GDPR, personal data are defined as follows:</p>
<p>"<i>'Personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
    person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
    directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name,
    an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
    specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
    identity of that natural person.</i>" This includes pseudonymised data.</p>
<p>Please choose "yes" if your dataset contains personal data other than the personal data to
    account for the dataset, such as the creator, the rights holder or citations. For instance,
    this applies when your dataset contains personal data from research subjects.</p>
<p>Please choose "no" if your dataset only contains personal data to account for the dataset,
    such as the creator, the rights holder or citations. This would typically be information
    that you provide as metadata below.</p>
<p>When you choose "yes", please note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The access category for your dataset will be Restricted Access, for which the DANS licence
        automatically applies.</li>
    <li>Personal data other than the personal data to account for the dataset must not be included
        in the metadata or in file names of your dataset.</li>
    <li>You and DANS must conclude a processing agreement. DANS will offer you a standard agreement.</li>
</ul>
